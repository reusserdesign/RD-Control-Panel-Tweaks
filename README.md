# RD-Control-Panel-Tweaks

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/ExpressionEngine-4%2B-3784B0.svg)

This add-on is used to modify default control panel styling in ExpressionEngine 4. Some of the styling is automatically changed while other parts, such as link and button colors, you have access to modify. You can now customize control panel colors, within reason, to match your brand!

## What is automatically changed?

- The styling on the 'Main' navigation menu has been modified so it feels more like a main navigation bar and less like the custom navigation bar.
- Fonts have been smoothed.
- Buttons across various add-ons, such as Structure and Assets, have been normalized.
- Spacing on the Entry Screen has been tweaked a little.
- A divided line between fields on the Entry Screen has been added.
- The overflow scroll on upper navigation elements has been removed.

## What can I change?

- Top Bar (Global Nav): background color, link color, link hover state color
- Link color and link hover state color
- Button color and button hover color (for both normal and action buttons).
- Ability to hide the 'Files' button per Member Group*.
- Ability to hide the 'Developers' button per Member Group*.

*Note: Only Member Groups with access to the control panel will show up in this list.
